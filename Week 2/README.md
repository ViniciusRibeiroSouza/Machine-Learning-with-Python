## Week 1

In this module, you will learn about applications of Machine Learning in different fields such as health care, banking, telecommunication, and so on. Youâ€™ll get a general overview of Machine Learning topics such as supervised vs unsupervised learning, and the usage of each algorithm. Also, you understand the advantage of using Python libraries for implementing Machine Learning models.

### Learning goals
- Give examples of Machine Learning in various industries.
- Outline the steps machine learning uses to solve problems.
- Provide examples of various techniques used in machine learning.
- Describe the Python libraries for Machine Learning.
- Explain the differences between Supervised and Unsupervised algorithms.
- Describe the capabilities of various algorithms.

## Week 2

In this module, you will get a brief intro to regression. You learn about Linear, Non-linear, Simple and Multiple regression, and their applications. You apply all these methods on two different datasets, in the lab part. Also, you learn how to evaluate your regression model, and calculate its accuracy.

### Learning goals
- Demonstrate understanding of the basics of regression.
- Demonstrate understanding of simple linear regression.
- Describe approaches for evaluating regression models.
- Describe evaluation metrics for determining accuracy of regression models.
- Demonstrate understanding of multiple linear regression.
- Demonstrate understanding of non-linear regression.
- Apply Simple and Multiple, Linear Regression on a dataset for estimation.
